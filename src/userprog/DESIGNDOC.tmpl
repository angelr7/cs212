    Our wait implemententation checks to see if it has children if not 
    it will return -1. Then it will loop through children, which is
    a list of struct child_process which the current thread created,
    looking for the child_process with the requested tid. If not found 
    return -1. If found check if wait has been called, if so return -1.
    Otherwise check if the child->status != INITIAL_STATUS if so return
    status. Otherwise we fall into the most interesting case.

    When wait has not been called previously on the child, and 
    status = INITIAL_STATUS, then we must wait for child to exit. 
    This is done using a condition variable wait_cond and lock wait_lock
    which are shared between the child and parent through child_process.
    We put the parent to sleep with wait_cond in a while loop ensuring 
    that only if the child status which we are waiting on is no longer 
    INITIAL_STATUS will we stop sleeping. 

    We wake up the parent thread in the bottom of exit_handler. When
    we are in the situation where the parent has not yet exited, we
    know it must be waiting on the child to exit. In this case we 
    cond_signal the parent by using the shared wait_cond and protect
    the signal using the shared wait_lock to wake up the parent. 

    We also implemented freeing so that the last process to exit is the
    one which frees. This is handled through a boolean in the child_process 
    struct.

    In the child_process struct we have a semaphore called wait_child. 
    In process_execute we first initialize the child process' 
    child_process. We then create the new thread and pass the new 
    child_process through the thread_create() call. We add this child to
    the parents list of children. We then make the parent wait until the
    child has finished start_process using sema_down(&wait_child).
    
    Passing the child_process through thread_create() gives us access to
    child_process in the childs call to start_process. At the end of 
    start_process, after the load has been completed we can see if the 
    load was done successfully through the success boolean. If sucess 
    is true we will wake up the parent using sema_up(&wait_child). If 
    unsuccessful we set the child_process' child_error boolean to true,
    wake up the parent using sema_up(&wait_child), and thread_exit().

    The sema_up wakes up the parent and we are back in process_execute. 
    At this point we check the child_process' child_error, If it is
    true return -1, otherwise finish as usual. This wait_child semaphore 
    ensures that the parent must wait until after the child thread has 
    loaded to finish process_execute(). The shared child_process struct 
    allows for information to easily be passed between parent and child.

Freeing:
    In our program freeing is handled by whoever uses the struct last. 
    This implementation is done using using a boolean in the shared
    child_process called tried_to_free. This will works regardless of
    if the parent waits for the child.

    If your are process C and are exiting you will check tried_to_free.
    If true, it means that your parent P has exited and you must free the 
    shared child_process. If tried_to_free is false it means that P 
    is alive and you will NOT free the child_process because P will 
    do it later.

    Similarly, if your are P and are exiting you will check tried_to_free.
    If true, it means that C has exited and you must free the 
    shared child_process. If tried_to_free is false it means that C 
    is alive and you will NOT free the child_process because C will 
    do it later.

    The special case where both a child and parent exit simultaneously is
    not possible. Our lock process_lock makes sure that both can not happen
    at once. The other case where a program runs infinitely will most likely
    be met with our program running out of memory considering our small file
    system and will be forced to exit the programs at some point. 


Case 1: P alive, waiting on C to exit:
    In the case where P is waiting for C and C has not exited
    our program waits for C to exit. 

    This is done using a condition variable wait_cond and lock wait_lock
    which are shared only between C and P through child_process.
    We put the parent to sleep with wait_cond in a while loop ensuring 
    that only if the child status which we are waiting on is no longer 
    INITIAL_STATUS will we stop sleeping. Here the wait_lock protects
    wait_cond from any race conditions. 

Case 2: P alive, waiting on C, C already exitted:

    In the case where P is waiting for C and C has exited our program
    will return the childs exit status, which is kept updated through
    the shared child_process. Any changes to child_process are protected
    by process_lock and can not have race conditions.  

In both cases 1 and 2 P will be the last process to use child_process.
Therefore as described above in our Freeing section the shared 
child_process struct will not be freed until P exits. 
This makes it so that we have no race conditions for this struct 
because only the parent will have access to the child_process since
the child will have exited when we eventually free. 

Case 3: P Exit, no waiting, C alive:
    In the case where P has exited and C is running. C will not need any
    information inside of P since all shared information will be kept
    alive through the shared child_process. When C is exiting we will
    see that since the parent has exited tried_to_free = true. Therefore
    C will free the shared child_process and will not signal the parent 
    since the parent has already exited.  

Case 4: P Exits after C exits, no waiting:
    C exits, but parent exits, parent will not need any information from 
    inside of the child thread and will also not wait for it. There will
    be no race conditions because since P is the last process to exit
    it will close child_process. As described in the Freeing section. 

Case 5: Special case, Both exit simultaneously:
    We do not need to worry about this case because it is not possible.
    Because of our use of locking through process lock one will always
    finish first and we will arrive in one of the 4 cases above.

Case 6: Child never exits, Parent never exits:
    Will run out of memory and will be caught and return with -1

want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

static struct list tick_list;
    The tick list holds all of the sleep durations for the blocked 
    threads in ascending order so our tick interrupt can wake 
    them up appropriately.

struct tick_list_item {
    int64_t ticks;
    struct thread *thread_ref;
    struct list_elem elem;
};
    This struct represents an item in the tick list. It has a
    list elem which is used to manage its position, a reference to a 
    sleeping thread, and a tick value for when the thread should wake up.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
When a function calls timer_sleep() we first disable interrupts. Then, we
check for a valid interval (i.e > 0) and create a new tick_list_item 
using the current running thread and the tick value. We then insert our 
tick_list_item into tick_list, ordering by ascending tick duration. We then 
block the thread. 

The timer_interrupt handler at every system tick loops through tick_list
and checks if the number of OS ticks is greater than each item's sleep duration. 
We then unblock the thread and remove its entry in the tick list if needed.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
When we find the first duration that has not elapsed we stop searching. 
We also carefully monitored our allocation of stack variables so that we
do not unnecessarily use memory and increase runtime. 


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
Race conditions are avoided because upon a timer interrupt, all threads
whose duration has passed will be woken up. Since the tick_list is ordered,
all of the threads will be woken up in the correct order as well. Unblocking 
all of the threads in order also allows the simple scheduler to maintain the 
correct thread ordering. 

When we disable interrupts we prevent other threads from inconsistently modifying 
shared variables such as tick_list. We also avoid time discrepencies from calculations
using the global ticks variable.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
When this situation occurs the interrupt would not be handled because 
for most of timer_sleep() interupts are disabled. 

If an interrupt were to occur before we disabled them, our if condition 
checks to make sure that the interval has not passed when the original 
thread is pushed back on the CPU.

             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct thread
{
  struct lock *lock_acquiring;
  struct lock *lock_releasing;
  struct list locks_holding;
};
    The added lock_acquiring and lock_releasing lock pointers keeps track of when
    a thread is in the middle of acquiring and releasing a lock. The locks_holding
    list keeps track of all the locks a thread is holding for the purposes of
    calculating priority donation values.

struct lock
{
  struct list_elem elem;
};
    This added list_elem is used to add locks to threads' locks_holding lists.


>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

In order to track priority donations, each thread keeps a list of all the locks
it is currently holding. When we want to get the priority of the thread, we take
the maximum between the threads priority and the maximum of the donated priorities
coming from the locks it is holding. Obtain the maximum of the donated priorities
by looping through all the locks the thread is holding and finding the maximum
priority of each locks waiters. This algorithm recursively calls get_thread_priority()
in order to calculate the priorities of the threads that are donating their priorities
to the original thread whose priority we are getting.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?
When choosing a thread to wake up, we use the list_max function to choose
the highest priority thread from the lists. Our less than function used
by list_max calls get_thread_priority to retrieve a threads priority and
returns the first thread with the maximum priority found in the list.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?
Within the lock_acquire function before calling sema_down, we set the
thread's lock_aquiring member to point to the lock. Within the sema_down
function, the thread will add itself to the lock semaphore's waiters list
and block. When the thread is able to continue within sema_down, it will 
check if it is currently aquiring a lock by checking if the threads 
lock_acquiring member is not NULL. If it is aquiring a lock, then we add 
the lock we are acquiring to the thread's locks_holding list and set 
lock_acquiring to NULL to signify that we are done with the process of 
acquiring this lock and exit sema_down.

We handle nested donations by adding acquired locks to each thread's locks_holding
list. When retrieving the thread's priority, we utilize the locks_holding list 
to calculated the thread's donated priority by looping through the list and 
getting the donated priority coming from the waiters of those locks. In the nested 
case, we also go through the waiting threads' locks_holding lists to retrieve 
their nested donated priorities.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.
In the list_release function we set the thread's lock_releasing member to point to
the lock that the thread is currently holding, prior to calling sema_up.

We initially tried an approach without a fixed-point file and calculated all 
the math in the calulate_load_avg, calculate_priority, and calculate_recent_cpu
functions. We were running into bugs and found that creating a fixed point file
made our thread code more readable, made it faster, and left less room for error
in our calculations between fixed points. Also, we used the set of functions in
fixed-point.c because there were other places where fixed pointer arithmetic was
needed such as increamenting recent_cpu every tick and fp_to_int_round_nearest
which was used in functions thread_get_load_avg and thread_get_recent_cpu. The
multiple use of these functions made it a good candidate to put in a seperate file
with function calls to not be rewritten.

               ARGUMENT PASSING
               ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
We did not create or modify any structs to implement argument passing. We also
did not make use of any global or static variables, and did not typedef any 
structs or other types.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?
We handle argument passing in the call to setup_stack in the load function. 
When we create a new process, we create a new thread that runs the 
start_process function. When this function runs, it calls the load function, 
which then calls setup_stack. We pass in the entire filename string, 
including arguments into setup_stack, so we can parse the necessary values 
and place them in the stack using the esp pointer.
In setup_stack, we make sure to only begin stack initialization if the page
is installed successfully. If this is the case, we initialize an argc 
variable and a 128-length list of char *'s (since pintos can only pass 128
bytes to the kernel, this is always guaranteed to be able to store all of
our process' arguments.) We then count the amount of space that is necessary 
for our non-whitespace characters, making sure to add space for null 
terminators. After this, we copy our cmdline string, and place it into a 
loop with strtok_r, so that we pull all of the words out of our string. For
every word we pull with strtok_r, we make sure to copy that string into 
the current location of esp, and offset esp downwards to account for the 
size of that string. After this is done, we make sure that our esp pointer
is four-byte aligned. With this managed, we then set a "return address" of
0 and push it on the stack, offestting esp by sizeof(int) afterwards. 
Finally, we then push the values of argc, the address of argv, and the 
address of all of the arguments of argv using this same logic. After 
pushing all values on the stack, we then offset esp one last time to 
be in its final position, right below PHYS_BASE.


---- RATIONALE ----
>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
According to the Linux Programmer's Manual (found by running "man strtok_r"), 
strtok_r is a reentrant version of strtok. strtok_r maintains its context
amongst different calls by using the saveptr variable. By doing this, we allow
multiple strings to be parsed concurrently using strtok_r. Since strtok doesn't 
have a saveptr variable, we wouldn't be able to parse multiple strings 
concurrently or parse strings in nested loops with it. 

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.
One advantage of this approach would be that all of our error-handling logic
can be condensed into the shell, rather than placing this load on the kernel.
This brings more security into our processing system, because all validation
is done on the user-side, and not on the kernel side where things are much
more volatile. There is also one less layer of indirection when the shell 
has the sole responsibility of parsing commands and subprocessing.

In general, this brings another advantage as well. By removing the need to
parse and validate these commands in the kernel, the UNIX approach is much 
more efficent and uses less memory for the kernel.

    Our wait implemententation checks to see if it has children if not 
    it will return -1. Then it will loop through children, which is
    a list of struct child_process which the current thread created,
    looking for the child_process with the requested tid. If not found 
    return -1. If found check if wait has been called, if so return -1.
    Otherwise check if the child->status != INITIAL_STATUS if so return
    status. Otherwise we fall into the most interesting case.

    When wait has not been called previously on the child, and 
    status = INITIAL_STATUS, then we must wait for child to exit. 
    This is done using a condition variable wait_cond and lock wait_lock
    which are shared between the child and parent through child_process.
    We put the parent to sleep with wait_cond in a while loop ensuring 
    that only if the child status which we are waiting on is no longer 
    INITIAL_STATUS will we stop sleeping. 

    We wake up the parent thread in the bottom of exit_handler. When
    we are in the situation where the parent has not yet exited, we
    know it must be waiting on the child to exit. In this case we 
    cond_signal the parent by using the shared wait_cond and protect
    the signal using the shared wait_lock to wake up the parent. 

    We also implemented freeing so that the last process to exit is the
    one which frees. This is handled through a boolean in the child_process 
    struct.

    In the child_process struct we have a semaphore called wait_child. 
    In process_execute we first initialize the child process' 
    child_process. We then create the new thread and pass the new 
    child_process through the thread_create() call. We add this child to
    the parents list of children. We then make the parent wait until the
    child has finished start_process using sema_down(&wait_child).
    
    Passing the child_process through thread_create() gives us access to
    child_process in the childs call to start_process. At the end of 
    start_process, after the load has been completed we can see if the 
    load was done successfully through the success boolean. If sucess 
    is true we will wake up the parent using sema_up(&wait_child). If 
    unsuccessful we set the child_process' child_error boolean to true,
    wake up the parent using sema_up(&wait_child), and thread_exit().

    The sema_up wakes up the parent and we are back in process_execute. 
    At this point we check the child_process' child_error, If it is
    true return -1, otherwise finish as usual. This wait_child semaphore 
    ensures that the parent must wait until after the child thread has 
    loaded to finish process_execute(). The shared child_process struct 
    allows for information to easily be passed between parent and child.

Freeing:
    In our program freeing is handled by whoever uses the struct last. 
    This implementation is done using using a boolean in the shared
    child_process called tried_to_free. 

    If your are process C and are exiting you will check tried_to_free.
    If true, it means that your parent has exited and you must free the 
    shared child_process. If tried_to_free is false it means that P 
    is alive and you will NOT free the child_process because P will 
    do it later.

    Similarly, if your are P and are exiting you will check tried_to_free.
    If true, it means that C has exited and you must free the 
    shared child_process. If tried_to_free is false it means that C 
    is alive and you will NOT free the child_process because C will 
    do it later.

    The special case where both a child and parent exit simultaneously is
    not possible. Our lock process_lock makes sure that both can not happen
    at once. The other case where a program runs infinitely will most likely
    be met with our program running out of memory considering our small file
    system and will be forced to exit the programs at some point. 

    Lastly, all processes close their open files in our exit handler. After 
    freeing all necessary children, each process loops through its list of 
    open files, and closes each file. In this loop, we also make sure to 
    free the corresponding fd_elem struct associated with it, since we 
    initialized it using malloc. Although we free the fd_elem every time, 
    we use file_close to close our file descriptors. This ensures that we 
    do not fully close a file until all processes who are accessing it have
    terminated.


Case 1: P alive, waiting on C to exit:
    In the case where P is waiting for C and C has not exited
    our program waits for C to exit. 

    This is done using a condition variable wait_cond and lock wait_lock
    which are shared only between C and P through child_process.
    We put the parent to sleep with wait_cond in a while loop ensuring 
    that only if the child status which we are waiting on is no longer 
    INITIAL_STATUS will we stop sleeping. Here the wait_lock protects
    wait_cond from any race conditions. 



Case 2: P alive, waiting on C to exit:

    In the case where P is waiting for C and C has exited our program
    will return the childs exit status, which is kept updated through
    the shared child_process. 

In both cases 1 and 2 P will be the last process to use child_process.
Therefore as described above in our Freeing section the shared 
child_process struct will not be freed until P exits. 
This makes it so that we have no race conditions for this struct 
because only the parent will have access to the child_process since
the child will have exited when we eventually free. 

Case 3: P Exit C exiting:

    In the case where P has exited and C is running. C will not need any
    information inside of P since all shared information will be kept
    alive through the shared child_process. When C is exiting we check to 
    see if the parent has exited. If so we will free ourselves and will not
    signal the parent as in the previous case.

    This is done using a condition variable wait_cond and lock wait_lock
    which are shared only between C and P through child_process.
    We put the parent to sleep with wait_cond in a while loop ensuring 
    that only if the child status which we are waiting on is no longer 
    INITIAL_STATUS will we stop sleeping. Here the wait_lock protects
    wait_cond from any race conditions. 

    In the case where P is waiting for C and C has exited our program
    will return the childs exit status, which is kept updated through
    the shared child_process. 

    In both cases Since C will be the last process to use child_process 
    the shared child_process struct will not be freed until C exits. 
    This makes it so that we have no race conditions for this struct 
    because only C will have access to the child_process since P will 
    have exited.
